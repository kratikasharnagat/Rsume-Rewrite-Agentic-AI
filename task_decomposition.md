🧩 Task Decomposition — ResumeAgent AI
The system is architected as a multi-agent orchestration pipeline. Each task is isolated to a specific agent, ensuring modularity, reliability, and superior quality control through iterative loops.

1. Phase: Data Ingestion & Environmental Context
Goal: Build a foundation of structured candidate data and real-world market requirements.

🔍 Analyzer Agent (Extraction)
Input: Raw text from user's current resume.
Process:
Identifies Personal Info (Name, Contact, LinkedIn).
Structures Experience & Projects into bulleted lists.
Extracts Education, Certifications, and Strengths.
Output: A comprehensive JSON representation of the candidate's profile.
🌐 Researcher Agent (Web Search)
Input: Target job role (e.g., "Frontend Developer").
Process:
Executes Tavily Search to find top 2026 hiring trends.
Identifies high-frequency ATS keywords.
Scans for required technical and soft skills for the specific role.
Output: A market trend report used to guide the scoring and rewriting phases.
2. Phase: Evaluation & Gap Analysis
Goal: Critically assess the current resume against the market research.

📊 Scorer Agent (The Judge)
Input: Analyzer Output + Researcher Output.
Process:
Uses LLM-as-Judge with a custom rubric.
Assigns an ATS compatibility score (0-100).
Identifies specific "Gaps" (e.g., "Missing React hooks experience", "Weak action verbs").
Output: A score report with actionable improvement tips.
3. Phase: Transformation & Quality Assurance
Goal: Execute the rewrite and ensure professional integrity.

✍️ Rewriter Agent (The Architect)
Input: All previous agent outputs.
Process:
Rewrites the professional summary for maximum impact.
Enhances experience bullets using the Action Verb + Task + Result formula.
Groups skills into logical categories.
Critique-Revise Loop:
After generating the first draft, the LLM Judge evaluates it for hallucinations and accuracy.
If inaccuracies are found, the Rewriter receives specific instructions to fix them.
Output: The finalized, polished resume data.
4. Phase: Orchestration & Delivery
Goal: Manage the lifecycle and stream updates to the user.

📦 Orchestrator (The Conductor)
Process:
Manages asyncio execution of agents (Parallel Analyzer & Researcher).
Handles state management between stages.
SSE Streaming: Sends real-time progress updates (e.g., "Scoring resume...") to the frontend via Server-Sent Events.
Output: The complete JSON report ready for UI rendering and TXT download.
