# Rsume-Rewrite-Agentic-AI
📝 ResumeAgent AI — Professional Multi-Agent Pipeline
A powerful multi-agent workflow that transforms raw resumes into high-impact, ATS-optimized professional documents. Each stage is handled by a specialized agent (Analyzer, Researcher, Scorer, Rewriter) coordinated by an Orchestrator with built-in LLM-as-Judge quality control.

The app features a FastAPI backend designed for Vercel serverless deployment and a modern SSE (Server-Sent Events) powered frontend for real-time progress tracking.

� How the pipeline works
Stage	Role	What happens
1	Analyzer	Deep-parses raw text into structured JSON. Extracts skills, experience, and projects while identifying initial weaknesses.
2	Researcher	Conducts real-time market research via Tavily Search to find trending skills and ATS keywords for the target role.
3	Scorer	Performs a "tough love" gap analysis. Uses LLM-as-Judge to evaluate the resume against research data and assign an ATS score.
4	Rewriter	Multi-turn transformation. Rewrites bullets with action verbs and quantification. Includes a critique-revise loop to ensure 100% data integrity (no hallucinations).

� Security & Accuracy
Data Integrity: The Rewriter Agent is governed by strict rules to prevent hallucinations. It never adds fake certifications or skills.
Privacy: No resume data is stored permanently. The pipeline runs in-memory and returns the result to the user.
Reliability: Built-in exponential backoff for Groq API rate limits (429 errors).
